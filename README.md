🖥️ Prodigy Infotech Internship – Software Development Projects
This repository showcases the projects I completed during my Software Development Internship at Prodigy Infotech. These projects helped me strengthen my coding skills, improve logical thinking, and gain hands-on experience with real-world problem-solving.

🚀 Projects Completed
1️⃣ Sudoku Solver
I developed a Sudoku Solver that can automatically solve any 9×9 Sudoku puzzle using the backtracking algorithm. The program explores possible solutions, checks constraints for rows, columns, and 3×3 grids, and fills the missing numbers accurately.

Key Learnings:

Implementation of recursion and backtracking.

Efficient constraint checking and validation logic.

Debugging and optimizing algorithms for better performance.

2️⃣ Random Number Guessing Game
I built an interactive Random Number Guessing Game where the user guesses a randomly generated number. The program provides feedback (too high/too low) and continues until the user guesses the correct number. It also tracks the number of attempts.

Key Learnings:

User input handling and loop control.

Building logic for interactive console applications.

Working with random number generation in Python.

📚 What I Learned
Improved Python programming and algorithmic thinking.

Gained experience in breaking problems into smaller, manageable steps.

Learned to write clean, structured, and efficient code.

Strengthened debugging and logical reasoning skills.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python 3.x

Tools: Any Python-supported IDE (VS Code / PyCharm)

🌟 Internship Experience
Working on these projects as part of my internship at Prodigy Infotech gave me an opportunity to apply core programming concepts to real problems, boosting my confidence and skills in software development.
